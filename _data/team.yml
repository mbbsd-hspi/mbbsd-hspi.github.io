    Claude Shannon-Harry Nyquist Technical Achievement Award](https://signalprocessingsociety.org/sites/default/files/uploads/community_involvement/awards/Claude_SH_Nyquist_Technical_Achievement_Award.pdf)
    (for contributions to spoken language processing technologies and their societal applications) from the IEEE Signal Processing 
    Society and the [2020 ACM ICMI Sustained Accomplishment Award](https://icmi.acm.org/2020/index.php?id=award). His research publications 
    have received the 2023 Richard Deswarte Prize in Digital History (for paper published in Digital Humanities Quarterly with Gabor Toth,
    Tim Hempel, Krishna Somandepalli), a 2018 ISCA Best Journal Paper Award (for paper published in Computer Speech and Language Journal with 
    Ming Li and Kyu Han), the Ten Year Technical Impact Award from ACM ICMI in 2014, a 2009 Best Transactions (Journal) Paper award (with Chul Min Lee) and a 
    2005 Best Transactions Paper Award (with Alexandros Potamianos) from the IEEE Signal Processing society for papers published in the IEEE Transactions on Speech 
    and Audio Processing.
    Shri Narayananâ€™s interdisciplinary research focuses on human-centered sensing/imaging, signal processing, and machine intelligence centered 
    on human communication, interaction, emotions, and behavior.  His work has a special emphasis on speech, audio, language, multimodal and biomedical 
    problems and applications with direct societal relevance in defense, security, health, media and the arts. His laboratory is supported by federal (NSF, 
    NIH, DARPA, IARPA, ONR, Army and DHS) and various foundation and industry grants. He has published over 1000 papers and has 19 granted U.S. patents . 
    His research and inventions have led to technology commercialization including through startups he co-founded: Behavioral Signals Technologies focused on 
    the telecommunication services and AI based conversational assistance industry and Lyssn focused on mental health care delivery, treatment and quality assurance.

- name: Mrigunka Sur
  role: Professor 
  image: assets/theme/images/mriganka.jpg
  description: >
    Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, USA
    
    > Mriganka Sur is the Newton Professor of Neuroscience in The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory 
    and Director of the Simons Center for the Social Brain at MIT, which he founded after 15 years as head 
    of the MIT Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences. Dr. Sur studies the organization, plasticity and 
    dynamics of the cerebral cortex of the brain using experimental and theoretical approaches. He has discovered 
    fundamental principles by which networks of the cerebral cortex are wired during development and change 
    dynamically during learning. His laboratory has identified gene networks underlying cortical plasticity, 
    and pioneered high resolution imaging methods to study cells, synapses and circuits of the intact brain. 
    His group has demonstrated novel mechanisms underlying disorders of brain development, and proposed innovative 
    strategies for treating such disorders. His laboratory has discovered core functional rules of inhibitory-excitatory 
    neuronal circuits in the cerebral cortex, and revealed dynamics of information processing across widespread cortical 
    areas. The impact of these discoveries, which answer long-standing questions about computations underlying learning, 
    decision-making and perception-action transformations, ranges from understanding dysregulation in brain disorders to 
    brain architectures for next-generation AI. 
    Dr. Sur received the B. Tech. degree in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, 
    and the PhD degree in Electrical Engineering from Vanderbilt University, Nashville. He has received numerous awards 
    and honors, most recently the Krieg Cortical Discoverer Prize, and delivered distinguished lectures world-wide. 
    He has trained over 80 doctoral students and postdoctoral fellows, and received awards for outstanding teaching and mentoring. 
    At MIT, he has been recognized with the Sherman Fairchild and Newton Chairs. He is an elected Fellow of the Royal Society of the UK, 
    the National Academy of Medicine, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, 
    the World Academy of Sciences, the Indian National Science Academy, and the American Institute of Medical and Biological Engineering.

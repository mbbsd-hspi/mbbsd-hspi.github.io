## **<span style="color:$gray-800">Workshop on Indian Music Analysis and Generative Applications (WIMAGA)</span>**

Welcome to the website of the Workshop on Indian Music Analysis and Generative Applications (WIMAGA), a Satellite Workshop of the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2025). The workshop will be held in conjunction with ICASSP 2025, which will take place in Hyderabad, India from April 06 to April 11, 2025. The workshop is planned to be co-located with ICASSP 2025 and held adjacent to the dates of the conference (exact date of the workshop will be announced soon). 

Music Information Research (MIR) spans a wide range of problems and tools that are ultimately grounded in signal processing and machine learning. With a long tradition of diverse art, folk and film music cultures and the recent growth of applications for music in an emerging market, India poses new challenges and provides novel opportunities to explore a multitude of research problems in MIR for Indian music. However, such research continues to be challenging due to the limited availability of annotated data and approaches that effectively integrate the cultural and social aspects into research methods, which is essential to mainstream applications for any music culture. Aiming to address these needs, challenges and opportunities in Indian music, the workshop will focus on papers related to computational approaches for the analysis, modeling and generation of Indian music taking into account its multilingual, multicultural and regional nuances. Specifically, the workshop will encourage interdisciplinary discussions that bring together research communities across the areas of audio and music signal processing, machine learning, music cognition, musicology, music production, music education and multimodal approaches to music retrieval.
